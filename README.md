# count-no-of-duplicates

This project counts the number of non-unique elements in a given list.

**Algorithm**

The code runs two loops, the outer loop compares the current element with all the inner elements, 
once a match is found we will add the current element in a list, also increment the counter for duplicate elements.
Make sure before increasing the counter check if this number already compared in the list.

This code can also be used to find the duplicates in a given list which we are printing.

**Testing**

For testing Spock and groovy framework is used.
